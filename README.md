Pixel Punching PHP Demo Code
================================================================================

Sample code for the presentation given in DallasPHP on 2012/06/12. It ended up
being a full stack with drivers to allow a single API to use different libraries
to demo GD and Imagick from the same script. It works via autoloading. The same
system also powers the web upload demo.

The Presentation: http://catch404.net/2012/06/pixel-punching-php-presentation-from-dallasphp/


Demo Environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Windows 7
* PHP 5.4.0
* CLI - Windows cmd.exe
* Web - PHP CLI-Server pointed at this folder.

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS ALPHA QUALITY STUFF EVERYPONY. This was worked on for about
a week for the presentation. It is released under the 2-Clause BSD license, so
if you try to power your actual website and it explodes, awl snap.
